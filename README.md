## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Test Controls
- Start a test by clicking the passage and typing.
- Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for passages of varying complexity
- Switch between "Timed (60s)" mode and "Passage" mode (timer counts up, no limit)
- Restart at any time to get a new random passage from the selected difficulty

Typing Experience
- See real-time WPM, accuracy, and time stats while typing
- See visual feedback showing correct characters (green), errors (red/underlined), and cursor position
- Correct mistakes with backspace (original errors still count against accuracy)

Results & Progress
- View results showing WPM, accuracy, and characters (correct/incorrect) after completing a test
- See a "Baseline Established!" message on their first test, setting their personal best
- See a "High Score Smashed!" celebration with confetti when beating their personal best
- Have their personal best persist across sessions via localStorage

UI & Responsiveness
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

## My process

### Most proud of

- **Accessibility-first implementation**: Built the site with semantic HTML5 and appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure it's usable by screen readers and keyboard-only users—without compromising design.

- **Clean cross-device input handling**: Designed a unified input handling system that works consistently across desktop and mobile, acounting for focus behavior and touch interactions.
